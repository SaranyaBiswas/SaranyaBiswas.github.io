# Research

My research focuses on understanding how **noise** (randomness) interacts with **nonlinear dynamical systems** and changes their stability, attractors, and long-term behavior.

## Areas of Work

### ⭐ Stochastic Attractors
- How noisy systems settle into probabilistic attractors  
- Differential stability and robustness under perturbations  

### ⭐ Noise-Induced Intermittency
- Detecting and characterizing intermittency triggered by multiplicative noise  
- Identifying transitions using stochastic basin stability  

### ⭐ Noisy Limit Cycles & Fixed Points
- Local and global stability under additive noise  
- Numerical tracking of stochastic cycles  

### ⭐ Basin Stability & Survivability  
- Quantifying resilience of states under uncertainty  
- Probabilistic basin boundaries

## Current Work
- Manuscripts on noise-induced intermittency and stochastic stability  
- Co-authoring a postgraduate textbook on dynamics (with Prof. A. Chatterjee, IIT Kanpur)  
- Developing computational tools for basin stability and stochastic attractors
