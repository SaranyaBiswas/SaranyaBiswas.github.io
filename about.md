# About Me

I am **Dr. Saranya Biswas**, a researcher working in the field of **Nonlinear and Stochastic Dynamical Systems**.  

I completed my **MS–PhD** from the **Department of Applied Mechanics, IIT Madras**, where I worked on the behavior of noisy dynamical systems, stability analysis, stochastic attractors, and noise-induced transitions.

I later worked as a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at **IIT Kanpur**, focusing on advanced topics in dynamics, stochasticity, and stability under uncertainty. I have also served as a **Visiting Assistant Professor** at **Techno India University**.
