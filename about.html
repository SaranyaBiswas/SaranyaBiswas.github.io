<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
I am a researcher specializing in <strong>nonlinear stochastic dynamics</strong>, focusing on noisy 
dynamical systems, stochastic stability, and uncertainty quantification. My research blends 
numerical simulation, probability theory, and analytical modelling to better understand 
complex dynamical behaviour under random forcing.
</p>

<p>
I completed my <strong>MS–PhD in Applied Mechanics at IIT Madras</strong>, working on the 
characterization of stochastic attractors and noise-driven transitions in nonlinear systems. 
Following this, I worked as a <strong>Project Engineer at IIT Kanpur</strong> under Prof. Anindya Chatterjee, 
exploring topics in survivability, noise-induced intermittency, and nonlinear vibrations.
</p>

<p>
I have experience in teaching undergraduate and postgraduate engineering courses, and I have 
presented my research at international conferences including PND (IIT Madras), ICoEV (Aberdeen), 
and CNSD (IIT Kanpur).
