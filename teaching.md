# Teaching

I have assisted in multiple undergraduate and postgraduate courses across IIT Madras and IIT Kanpur.

---

## Course Assistantships (IIT Madras)
- **AM5600 — Computational Methods in Mechanics**  
- **AM5400 — Experimental Stress Analysis Lab**  
- **AM2540 — Applied Mechanics Lab**

---

## Course Assistantships (IIT Kanpur)
- **ME454 — Numerical Solutions in Engineering Mechanics**  
- **ME850 — Basic Control Systems**

---

## Teaching Philosophy
I emphasize:
- Clear intuition before equations  
- Visual and numerical understanding of dynamics  
- Active learning  
- Real-world examples in mechanics and stochastic systems

## Other Academic Work
- Co-authoring a textbook on postgraduate dynamics (with Prof. A. Chatterjee, IIT Kanpur)  
- Developer of a randomized question-paper generator (2025)
